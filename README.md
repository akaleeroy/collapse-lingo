## Agnotology

> The study of culturally induced ignorance or doubt, particularly the publication of inaccurate or misleading scientific data. The neologism was coined by Robert N. Proctor, a Stanford University professor specializing in the history of science and technology. Its name derives from the Neoclassical Greek word ·ºÑŒ≥ŒΩœâœÉŒπœÇ, agn≈çsis, "not knowing" (confer Attic Greek ·ºÑŒ≥ŒΩœâœÑŒøœÇ "unknown"), and -ŒªŒøŒ≥ŒØŒ±, -logia. More generally, the term also highlights the increasingly common condition where more knowledge of a subject leaves one more uncertain than before.

> A prime example of the deliberate production of ignorance cited by Proctor is the tobacco industry's conspiracy to **manufacture doubt about the cancer risks of tobacco use.** Under the banner of science, the industry produced research about everything except tobacco hazards to exploit public uncertainty. Some causes of culturally induced ignorance are media neglect, corporate or governmental secrecy and suppression, document destruction, and myriad forms of inherent or avoidable culturopolitical selectivity, inattention, and forgetfulness.

There‚Äôs every reason to believe he was right. In technological terms, we are quite capable of this. And yet it didn‚Äôt happen. Instead, technology has been marshaled, if anything, to figure out ways to make us all work more. In order to achieve this, jobs have had to be created that are, effectively, pointless. Huge swathes of people, in Europe and North America in particular, spend their entire working lives performing tasks they secretly believe do not really need to be performed. The moral and spiritual damage that comes from this situation is profound. It is a scar across our collective soul. Yet virtually no one talks about it.

[EROI](#energy-return-on-energy-invested). As more energy must be used to acquire additional sources of energy, myriad economic problems will occur. Higher input costs lead to higher energy prices for the consumer, although the process is not a smooth one. Higher energy prices choke off demand, helping precipitate a recession. The recession reduces energy prices, helping to restore prosperity. The global peak of oil looks more like an ‚Äúundulating plateau,‚Äù and the uncertainty adversely impacts the financing of future high cost energy sources.

## Creeping normalcy 

<kbd>[üë§ Jared Diamond](#jared-diamond)</kbd>

> Creeping normalcy is a term used to describe how gradual changes can be accepted as the normal situation if these changes happen slowly, or incrementally. Jared Diamond made the term creeping normalcy popular in his Pulitzer prize winning book, _Collapse ‚Äì How Societies Choose to Fail or Succeed_. Diamond outlines how politicians use the term "creeping normalcy" to refer to such slow trends concealed within noisy fluctuations. If the economy, schools, traffic congestion, or anything else deteriorate slowly, it's often difficult to recognize the change from previous years. The gradual and incremental changes are difficult to see, thus normalcy is difficult to recognise over short periods. It may take a few decades of a long sequence of such slight year-to-year changes before people realise that conditions were much better previously. What is accepted as normal now is a result of gradual changes, or creeping downwards.

## Demand destruction

[Demand destruction](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demand_destruction "Demand destruction - Wikipedia")

> Demand destruction is a permanent downward shift on the demand curve in the direction of lower demand of a commodity, such as energy products, induced by a prolonged period of high prices or constrained supply.

> It's one of the repeated lessons of economic history that money in the hands of the rich does much less good for the economy as a whole than money in the hands of the working classes and the poor. The reasoning here is as simple as it is inescapable. Industrial economies survive and thrive on consumer expenditures, but consumer expenditures are limited by the ability of consumers to buy the things they want and need. As money is diverted away from the lower end of the economic pyramid, you get demand destruction ‚Äî the process by which those who can't afford to buy things stop buying them ‚Äî and consumer expenditures fall off. The rich, by contrast, divert a large share of their income out of the consumer economy into investments; the richer they get, the more of the national wealth ends up in investments rather than consumer expenditures; and as consumer expenditures falter, and investments linked to the consumer economy falter in turn, more and more money ends up in illiquid speculative vehicles that are disconnected from the productive economy and do nothing to stimulate demand. That's what happened in the 1920s.

something like a ‚Äúconversation‚Äù, but in certain schools of philosophy it has a more
specialized meaning, namely, the social boundary which defines what can be said about a
particular topic, or, as expressed by the contemporary philosopher Judith Butler, ‚Äúthe limits
of acceptable speech‚Äù. This is very similar to the concept of the ‚ÄúOverton Window‚Äù as
explained in [this essay by Neal Devers](http://thefutureprimaeval.net/the-overton-bubble/).

## Dried sea squirrels

> Sea squirrels are pale, sickly-looking, and, above all, sad. Dried ones doubly so. They are endowed with flabby bags for a body, some ineffectual spiny tendrils, and dangling dark bits of uncertain purpose. One might conjecture that they are mutant shellfish that survived having their shells dissolved by the carbonic acid in the seawater. Being vegans, the vegans would never think of eating one; nor anything else that washes up on the shores of that brownish, carbonated ocean, almost lifeless after that final, desperate binge of coal-burning that occurred just as oil and gas were running out. Picking dead sea squirrels off the beach with a pointed stick is an unpleasant chore, making it useful for teaching children the subtle difference between work and play. Sea squirrels have but two charms: they are at times plentiful, and, dried into flat chips, they burn with a clean, yellow flame ‚Äì not bad for illumination, and convenient for cooking the food which the vegans both plant and harvest all along the shore.

Example: two tribes in the same bioregion experience fluctuations in productivity at the same time, and fight when drought/flood/locusts hits. They are engaged in competition for the same resources, and in cooperation with tribes from different regions - higher up the mountains, lower down the plains, etc.

## Ghost acreage

<kbd>[üë§ William R. Catton Jr.](#william-r-catton-jr)</kbd> - Overshoot

> Q: Could you elaborate on what ‚Äúghost acreage‚Äù is and why it is important to Britain‚Äôs Industrial Revolution?

> A: Ghost acreage is a term coined by Kenneth Pomeranz to help explain how Britain and other western European nations industrialized. The basic idea of ‚Äúghost acreage‚Äù is that imperial powers, like Britain, France, the Netherlands, and others, could draw upon resources from lands outside their borders, enabling those nations to support much larger economies than they otherwise could. For example, because of the economic connection between Britain and the United States, the cotton mills of Britain added ‚Äúghost acreage‚Äù from the U.S. South. This freed up good land in Britain for farmers to grow more food to feed the rapidly growing industrial population of Britain. If the British were to try to produce cotton within their own national borders, they would not only struggle to grow it in the wrong climate, but alternatives such as flax or sheep would chew up valuable acres of land British farmers could otherwise be using to grow food. Ghost acreage also comes into play when discussing new types of energy, such as coal. British industrialists could have burned wood to fuel their new machines, but they would have had to purchase and burn wood from throughout Europe and North America at great expense. By burning millions of tons of coal, it was as if the British had suddenly acquired billions of acres of underground forests. As with plantations, the use of coal freed up land for other purposes, such as agriculture, or it allowed for wood to be used in shipbuilding and construction instead of as fuel. Ghost acreage is an important concept because it reminds us of the ecological aspects of the industrial revolution; by drawing on natural resources from overseas and underground, the small island nation of Britain was able to escape its ecological constraints and start the Industrial Revolution.

high tech dip
:   entombed complexity. a pattern of using high technology to reduce reliance on high technology in the future.  
    _Those folks over at the lab are using artificial neural networks to compress all that knowledge into a handful of slide rules_

Making use of advanced technology today to vet best practices that can be passed on and implemented by low-tech means.

Example: arriving at simpler proxies for high-tech tests. Listened to Dan Kittridge speaking about which lab he works with to get his soil tested, rarer minerals were tested as a bonus. If the tests rely on a burdensome technological suite, maybe we can leverage AI pattern matching to displace those tests, relying only on simpler DIY tests but getting sufficient information from them.

Another example: (mechanical engineering) genetic algorhythm generating millions of designs for a part, stress testing all of them in computer simulation and selecting the most optimal solution. That design can then be copied by craftsmen with hand tools. Ideally it is distributed with documentation (mentioning what it's optimized for, how and why). Or only the form was passed on, to be reproduced _in the dark._ A technology suite that requires high technology only on the first iterations.

Another different example: using advances in cognitive science to develop teaching and learning methodologies, maximizing the chance that more people will learn new skills required by changing circumstances, faster.

Because the high technology that generated the artifact is lost or unsustainable in the new context a high tech dip is a [dead man walking](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/dead_man_walking) technological suite.

### Sprints and scrambles

As a way to preserve benefits of high complexity, along the arc of collapse we may see a scramble for high tech dips, sprints to rules of thumb. Seeing complex systems simplify (collapse), people will want to extract value from them before they're gone for good. To do so they will have to apply this pattern.

> The monkey trap is, as the name suggests, a device for trapping monkeys. It is ingenuous in its simplicity, and also in the fact that it does not actually trap the monkey at all: it is the monkey that does the trapping. The trap consists of a hollowed-out gourd tied to a tree using a vine. The gourd has an opening just big enough to admit a monkey's paw when it isn't clenched into a fist. Inside is a banana. The monkey reaches inside, grabs the banana, but cannot withdraw it. Even as the hunter approaches to collect it, it cannot bring itself to unclench its fist, let go of the banana and escape. What traps the monkey is the monkey's own internal cost/benefit analysis, which is slanted toward the short term, coupled with its inability to consider the long-term effect of its short-term decisions. It is a perfect metaphor for what has caused the US to go off the rails.

## Progress

See [Civil religion of progress](#civil-religion-of-progress)

## Progressivism

What social scientists label a ‚Äúprogressivist‚Äù view supposes that cultural complexity is intentional and that it emerged through the inventiveness of our ancestors. Progressivism is the dominant ideology of free-market societies. A sort of ancestor myth. The concepts of civilization and progress have a status in the cosmology of industrial societies that amounts to what anthropologists call ‚Äúancestor myths.‚Äù Ancestor myths validate a contemporary social order by presenting it as a natural and sometimes heroic progression from earlier times.

([Joseph Tainter - Human Resource Use - Timing and Implications for Sustainability](http://www.theoildrum.com/node/5745))

The Utterly Dismal Theorem - directly challenges the progressivist view:
Any technical improvement can only relieve misery for a while, for as long as misery is the only check on population, the improvement will enable population to grow, and will soon enable more people to live in misery than before. The final result of improvements, therefore, is to increase the equilibrium population, which is to increase the sum total of human misery (Boulding, 1959: vii [emphases in original]).

[Cassandra's Legacy: Some reflections on the Twilight of the Oil Age - part I](http://cassandralegacy.blogspot.com/2016/07/some-reflections-on-twilight-of-oil-age.html)

> Many readers are no doubt familiar with the so-called ‚ÄúRed Queen‚Äù effect illustrated in Figure 2 ‚Äì to have to run fast to stay put, and even faster to be able to move forward. The OI is fully caught in it.

![Figure 2 ‚Äì Stuck on a one track to nowhere](http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-PVwipqiMKVE/V4TvbcHkOpI/AAAAAAAABmM/tcYtD14-vhggvSMoE_LN4wYhJI_tgH9pQCK4B/s1600/nGeni-Looking%2Bdown%2Bthe%2Bbarrel-v10.3.006.png)

> ‚ÄòNow, here, you see, it takes all the running you can do, to keep in the same place. If you want to get somewhere else, you must run at least twice as fast as that!‚Äô - Lewis Carroll - Through the Looking-glass

Due to the rapid decline of net energy per barrel, the Oil Industry is under the sway of the **Red Queen Effect**. It must _run_ faster and faster, pumping more and more oil per year, to meet end-users' demands -- ditto for all other fossil and nuclear resources that are subject to the same Red Queen Effect.
But the net energy/barrel all need to keep running will have run out by about 2026.

> ‚ÄòNow, here, you see, if you run too fast you die!‚Äô
(paraphrasing Lewis Carroll)

All alternatives, PVs, wind turbines, biomass, shale oil, tar sands, new nuclear etc. are under the sway of the **Inverse Red Queen Effect**:

- if they grow at above 7%/year, the energy needed for their build out drains net energy out of the industrial world, just when much more of it is required
- while they actually need to grow at 35%/year to address the _Perfect Storm_ over the next 10 years ‚Äì at that rate the net energy drain would kill the industrial world

Currently, globally, about 88% of all energy resources are used wastefully -- a waste worth over ‚Ç¨5 trillion/year globally. **However, by retrieving waste heat and making productive use of it, it is feasible to sustainably circumvent the RQ & 1/RQ Effects & tap into those lost funds**

It is likely that something like that will happen to today's smartphones - right now, they are wonderful devices, but they are in a condition of resource overshoot. In the future, we will not be able to maintain their extreme performance facing the increasing costs of rare mineral resources. That doesn't mean that smartphones will disappear (although that's not impossible) but it means that some kind of compromise between performance and cost will have to be reached.

> Of course you may not be able to translate from Latin on the spot. For that, being Italian gives you a definite advantage. But let me just point out a word to you: "circumlatrantium" . which refers to barbarians who are, literally, "barking around" the empire's borders. They are like dogs barking and running around; and not just barking - they are trying hard to get in. It is almost a scene from a horror movie. A nightmare. So the author of "Of matters of war" is thinking of how to get rid of these monsters. But his solutions were not so good. Actually it was just wishful thinking. None of these strange weapons were ever built. Even our 4th century author, therefore, fails completely in understanding what were the real problems of the Empire.

The opposite of specialized. A very specialized tool is harder to repair and may become obsolete, losing all value.
Universally usable goods are good news for resilience and barter.

## Unserious

Way to describe delusional responses to the challenges of collapse, hinging on an incomplete picture of the problem and/or fallacies: wishful thinking, infinite substitutability, cornucopianism, infinite growth on a finite planet.

## Urban myth

One of the central myths of modern society is that the process of urbanization (and slumification‚Äîfavelas are currently the fastest-growing form of human habitation) is due to city life being ‚Äúmore attractive‚Äù and farming becoming ‚Äúmore efficient.‚Äù Fewer people want to or need to inhabit the wider landscape, the story goes, and so they are moving to the cities. And this, some say, is simply a good thing. But the real cause of this rapid urbanization is that economic activity is moving to the city‚Äîbecause localized, artisanal production cannot compete with centralized manufacturing. This is a temporary dislocation made possible by burning fossil fuels.

[White's Law - Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White's_law)

> White's law, named after Leslie White and published in 1943, states that, other factors remaining constant, "culture evolves as the amount of energy harnessed per capita per year is increased, or as the efficiency of the instrumental means of putting the energy to work is increased".
