### Demand destruction

[Demand destruction](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demand_destruction "Demand destruction - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia")

> Demand destruction is a permanent downward shift on the demand curve in the direction of lower demand of a commodity, such as energy products, induced by a prolonged period of high prices or constrained supply.

> It's one of the repeated lessons of economic history that money in the hands of the rich does much less good for the economy as a whole than money in the hands of the working classes and the poor. The reasoning here is as simple as it is inescapable. Industrial economies survive and thrive on consumer expenditures, but consumer expenditures are limited by the ability of consumers to buy the things they want and need. As money is diverted away from the lower end of the economic pyramid, you get demand destruction — the process by which those who can't afford to buy things stop buying them — and consumer expenditures fall off. The rich, by contrast, divert a large share of their income out of the consumer economy into investments; the richer they get, the more of the national wealth ends up in investments rather than consumer expenditures; and as consumer expenditures falter, and investments linked to the consumer economy falter in turn, more and more money ends up in illiquid speculative vehicles that are disconnected from the productive economy and do nothing to stimulate demand. That's what happened in the 1920s.

### Agnotology

> The study of culturally induced ignorance or doubt, particularly the publication of inaccurate or misleading scientific data. The neologism was coined by Robert N. Proctor, a Stanford University professor specializing in the history of science and technology. Its name derives from the Neoclassical Greek word ἄγνωσις, agnōsis, "not knowing" (confer Attic Greek ἄγνωτος "unknown"), and -λογία, -logia. More generally, the term also highlights the increasingly common condition where more knowledge of a subject leaves one more uncertain than before.

> A prime example of the deliberate production of ignorance cited by Proctor is the tobacco industry's conspiracy to **manufacture doubt about the cancer risks of tobacco use.** Under the banner of science, the industry produced research about everything except tobacco hazards to exploit public uncertainty. Some causes of culturally induced ignorance are media neglect, corporate or governmental secrecy and suppression, document destruction, and myriad forms of inherent or avoidable culturopolitical selectivity, inattention, and forgetfulness.

### Progressivism

What social scientists label a “progressivist” view supposes that cultural complexity is intentional and that it emerged through the inventiveness of our ancestors. Progressivism is the dominant ideology of free-market societies. A sort of ancestor myth. The concepts of civilization and progress have a status in the cosmology of industrial societies that amounts to what anthropologists call “ancestor myths.” Ancestor myths validate a contemporary social order by presenting it as a natural and sometimes heroic progression from earlier times.

([Joseph Tainter - Human Resource Use - Timing and Implications for Sustainability](http://www.theoildrum.com/node/5745))

The Utterly Dismal Theorem - directly challenges the progressivist view:
Any technical improvement can only relieve misery for a while, for as long as misery is the only check on population, the improvement will enable population to grow, and will soon enable more people to live in misery than before. The final result of improvements, therefore, is to increase the equilibrium population, which is to increase the sum total of human misery (Boulding, 1959: vii [emphases in original]).

### [Dunbar's number](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dunbar%27s_number) <kbd>👤 Dmitry Orlov</kbd>

> Dunbar's number is a suggested cognitive limit to the number of people with whom one can maintain stable social relationships—relationships in which an individual knows who each person is and how each person relates to every other person.

Commonly used value: 150 people.

### The urban myth
One of the central myths of modern society is that the process of urbanization (and slumification—favelas are currently the fastest-growing form of human habitation) is due to city life being “more attractive” and farming becoming “more efficient.” Fewer people want to or need to inhabit the wider landscape, the story goes, and so they are moving to the cities. And this, some say, is simply a good thing. But the real cause of this rapid urbanization is that economic activity is moving to the city—because localized, artisanal production cannot compete with centralized manufacturing. This is a temporary dislocation made possible by burning fossil fuels.

### Alpha Strategy
Book by <kbd>[👤 John Pugsley](http://www.worldcat.org/search?q=au%3APugsley%2C+John+A.&qt=hot_author)</kbd>

The notion that fiat money punishes savers therefore storing value can only be accomplished by acquiring a diversified portfolio of hard tangible goods that don't spoil. Examples include stuff that you'll use or industrial metals that have to be in demand.

### Surplus
See <kbd>👤 Toby Hemenway</kbd>
> [...] humans have rarely had surplus energy. Surpluses are quickly dissipated by growth in consumption. Since humans have rarely had surpluses, the availability of energy cannot be the primary driver of cultural evolution.

The great physicist Max Planck, in a statement that Nicholas Rescher calls 'Planck's Principle of Increasing Effort, observed that "...with every advance [in science] the difficulty of the task is increased" (Rescher 1980)

Energy averaging systems 
Regional economic symbiosis and spatial energy averaging are a method of countering productivity fluctuations.
Example: 2 tribes in the same bioregion experience fluctuations in productivity at the same time, and fight when drought/flood/locusts hits. They are engaged in competition for the same resources, and in cooperation with tribes from different regions - higher up the mountains, lower down the plains, etc.
is an \#Adaptation and a \#Criterium

It stands to reason that the "best places to be" for collapse are regions with huge bioregional diversity - ocean to mountain, tropical to temperate. Countries that are big and diverse, where you can change bioregion while still avoiding the hassle of crossing the border.

* Ghost acreage
via Overshoot

Q: Could you elaborate on what “ghost acreage” is and why it is important to Britain’s Industrial Revolution?

A: Ghost acreage is a term coined by Kenneth Pomeranz to help explain how Britain and other western European nations industrialized.  The basic idea of “ghost acreage” is that imperial powers, like Britain, France, the Netherlands, and others, could draw upon resources from lands outside their borders, enabling those nations to support much larger economies than they otherwise could.  For example, because of the economic connection between Britain and the United States, the cotton mills of Britain added “ghost acreage” from the U.S. South.  This freed up good land in Britain for farmers to grow more food to feed the rapidly growing industrial population of Britain.  If the British were to try to produce cotton within their own national borders, they would not only struggle to grow it in the wrong climate, but alternatives such as flax or sheep would chew up valuable acres of land British farmers could otherwise be using to grow food. Ghost acreage also comes into play when discussing new types of energy, such as coal.  British industrialists could have burned wood to fuel their new machines, but they would have had to purchase and burn wood from throughout Europe and North America at great expense.  By burning millions of tons of coal, it was as if the British had suddenly acquired billions of acres of underground forests.  As with plantations, the use of coal freed up land for other purposes, such as agriculture, or it allowed for wood to be used in shipbuilding and construction instead of as fuel.  Ghost acreage is an important concept because it reminds us of the ecological aspects of the industrial revolution; by drawing on natural resources from overseas and underground, the small island nation of Britain was able to escape its ecological constraints and start the Industrial Revolution.

* Creeping normalcy @Jared Diamond

> Creeping normalcy is a term used to describe how gradual changes can be accepted as the normal situation if these changes happen slowly, or incrementally. Jared Diamond made the term creeping normalcy popular in his Pulitzer prize winning book, _Collapse – How Societies Choose to Fail or Succeed_. Diamond outlines how politicians use the term "creeping normalcy" to refer to such slow trends concealed within noisy fluctuations. If the economy, schools, traffic congestion, or anything else deteriorate slowly, it's often difficult to recognize the change from previous years. The gradual and incremental changes are difficult to see, thus normalcy is difficult to recognise over short periods. It may take a few decades of a long sequence of such slight year-to-year changes before people realise that conditions were much better previously. What is accepted as normal now is a result of gradual changes, or creeping downwards.

> Many readers are no doubt familiar with the so-called “Red Queen” effect illustrated in Figure 2 – to have to run fast to stay put, and even faster to be able to move forward.  The OI is fully caught in it.

![Figure 2 – Stuck on a one track to nowhere](http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-PVwipqiMKVE/V4TvbcHkOpI/AAAAAAAABmM/tcYtD14-vhggvSMoE_LN4wYhJI_tgH9pQCK4B/s1600/nGeni-Looking%2Bdown%2Bthe%2Bbarrel-v10.3.006.png)

> ‘Now, here, you see, it takes all the running you can do, to keep in the same place. If you want to get somewhere else, you must run at least twice as fast as that!’ - Lewis Carroll - Through the Looking-glass

Due to the rapid decline of net energy per barrel, the Oil Industry is under the sway of the **Red Queen Effect**. It must _run_ faster and faster, pumping more and more oil per year, to meet end-users' demands -- ditto for all other fossil and nuclear resources that are subject to the same Red Queen Effect.
But the net energy/barrel all need to keep running will have run out by about 2026.

> ‘Now, here, you see, if you run too fast you die!’
(paraphrasing Lewis Carroll)

All alternatives, PVs, wind turbines, biomass, shale oil, tar sands, new nuclear etc. are under the sway of the **Inverse Red Queen Effect**:

- if they grow at above ~7%/year, the energy needed for their build out drains net energy out of the industrial world, just when much more of it is required
- while they actually need to grow at ~35%/year to address the _Perfect Storm_ over the next 10 years -- at that rate the net energy drain would kill the industrial world

Currently, globally, about 88% of all energy resources are used wastefully -- a waste worth over €5 trillion/year globally. **However, by retrieving waste heat and making productive use of it, it is feasible to sustainably circumvent the RQ & 1/RQ Effects & tap into those lost funds**

### Bridge Technology

<kbd>Proposed</kbd>  

Those AI data science tasks that can be performed to arrive at proxies so you don't have to do high-tech tests.

Listened to Dan Kittridge speaking about which lab he works with to get his soil tested, rarer minerals were tested as a bonus. If the tests rely on a burdensome technological suite, maybe we can leverage AI pattern matching to displace those tests, relying only on simpler DIY tests but getting more insight from them.

Designing assets to be bought by the rich in the present that will ultimately end up stranded, to be used as raw material by salvage societies.

### Resource Overshoot

> The best example of this phenomenon is, I think, with today's planes. They have noticeably slowed down from the time of the supersonic Concorde, to emphasize efficiency and comfort. The Concorde was simply too expensive to be a practical technology: it was a plane in overshoot. It is likely that something like that will happen to today's smartphones - right now, they are wonderful devices, but they are in a condition of resource overshoot. In the future, we will not be able to maintain their extreme performance facing the increasing costs of rare mineral resources. That doesn't mean that smartphones will disappear (although that's not impossible) but it means that some kind of compromise between performance and cost will have to be reached.
