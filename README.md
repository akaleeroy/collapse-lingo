## Agnotology

> The study of culturally induced ignorance or doubt, particularly the publication of inaccurate or misleading scientific data. The neologism was coined by Robert N. Proctor, a Stanford University professor specializing in the history of science and technology. Its name derives from the Neoclassical Greek word ·ºÑŒ≥ŒΩœâœÉŒπœÇ, agn≈çsis, "not knowing" (confer Attic Greek ·ºÑŒ≥ŒΩœâœÑŒøœÇ "unknown"), and -ŒªŒøŒ≥ŒØŒ±, -logia. More generally, the term also highlights the increasingly common condition where more knowledge of a subject leaves one more uncertain than before.

> A prime example of the deliberate production of ignorance cited by Proctor is the tobacco industry's conspiracy to **manufacture doubt about the cancer risks of tobacco use.** Under the banner of science, the industry produced research about everything except tobacco hazards to exploit public uncertainty. Some causes of culturally induced ignorance are media neglect, corporate or governmental secrecy and suppression, document destruction, and myriad forms of inherent or avoidable culturopolitical selectivity, inattention, and forgetfulness.

> In the year 1930, John Maynard Keynes predicted that, by century‚Äôs end, technology would have advanced sufficiently that countries like Great Britain or the United States would have achieved a 15-hour work week. There‚Äôs every reason to believe he was right. In technological terms, we are quite capable of this. And yet it didn‚Äôt happen. Instead, technology has been marshaled, if anything, to figure out ways to make us all work more. In order to achieve this, jobs have had to be created that are, effectively, pointless. Huge swathes of people, in Europe and North America in particular, spend their entire working lives performing tasks they secretly believe do not really need to be performed. The moral and spiritual damage that comes from this situation is profound. It is a scar across our collective soul. Yet virtually no one talks about it.

> The fundamental energy problem facing cities, nations, and the world is, and will be in the future, the problem of falling
[EROI](#energy-return-on-energy-invested). As more energy must be used to acquire additional sources of energy, myriad economic problems will occur. Higher input costs lead to higher energy prices for the consumer, although the process is not a smooth one. Higher energy prices choke off demand, helping precipitate a recession. The recession reduces energy prices, helping to restore prosperity. The global peak of oil looks more like an ‚Äúundulating plateau,‚Äù and the uncertainty adversely impacts the financing of future high cost energy sources.

[Climate change adaptation - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Climate_change_adaptation)

climate change adaptation
:    adjustments to natural or human systems in response to actual or expected climate change, including increases in the frequency or severity of weather-related disasters. _The IPCC defines adaptation as "the process of adjustment to actual or expected climate and its effects. In human systems, adaptation seeks to moderate or avoid harm or exploit beneficial opportunities. In some natural systems, human intervention may facilitate adjustment to expected climate and its effects"_ Examples: flood defences, planning laws, irrigation systems (Singh et al, 2016)

## Climate change mitigation

[Climate change mitigation - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Climate_change_mitigation)

climate change mitigation
:    actions to limit the magnitude or rate of long-term global warming and its related effects. Examples: reductions in anthropogenic emissions of greenhouse gases (GHGs), increasing capacity of carbon sinks such as reforestation

>  Important steps on climate mitigation and adaptation have been taken over the past decade. However, these steps could now be regarded as equivalent to walking up a landslide. If the landslide had not already begun, then quicker and bigger steps would get us to the top of where we want to be. Sadly, the latest climate data, emissions data and
data on the spread of carbon-intensive lifestyles show that the landslide has already begun.

cloaked adaptation
:   building up or promoting collapse transferrable skills. Example: physical fitness

These are activities that work in pre-crisis contexts but also put one in a better position when SHTF. Identifying these makes you better able to relate with people of a wider spectrum of collapse awareness. People may be more receptive to proposals framed without involving collapse. Cloaking adaptation initiatives leaves the option of deferring or avoiding the psychological cost of coming to terms with collapse ([ignore-ance](#ignore-ance)), which may be desirable.

> Here in the United States if you slip and fall, generally you go to a hospital and get it fixed. In New Guinea if you make a mistake you may well end up dead or crippled for the rest of your life. And so in New Guinea I learned through incidents, through close calls I've learned to be very careful. I've taken that attitude with me. If drives my wife and my sons and my friends crazy because I'm always attentive to what could go wrong, but that contributed to the fact that I'm still healthy in my early 80s and hope to carry on. So, one of the prime lessons I learned from New Guinea is to anticipate the dangers, the 1-in-100 danger, but if you do it 100 times... In New Guinea if you sleep under a dead tree the chances are 1000 to 1 the dead tree will fall on you that night, but if you're a New Guinean who is going to sleep in the jungle and you sleep in the jungle for 3 years (1095 days) the dead tree will fall on you and you'll be dead.

## Creeping normalcy

<kbd>[üë§ Jared Diamond](#jared-diamond)</kbd>

> Creeping normalcy is a term used to describe how gradual changes can be accepted as the normal situation if these changes happen slowly, or incrementally. Jared Diamond made the term creeping normalcy popular in his Pulitzer prize winning book, _Collapse ‚Äì How Societies Choose to Fail or Succeed_. Diamond outlines how politicians use the term "creeping normalcy" to refer to such slow trends concealed within noisy fluctuations. If the economy, schools, traffic congestion, or anything else deteriorate slowly, it's often difficult to recognize the change from previous years. The gradual and incremental changes are difficult to see, thus normalcy is difficult to recognise over short periods. It may take a few decades of a long sequence of such slight year-to-year changes before people realise that conditions were much better previously. What is accepted as normal now is a result of gradual changes, or creeping downwards.

## Demand destruction

[Demand destruction](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demand_destruction "Demand destruction - Wikipedia")

> Demand destruction is a permanent downward shift on the demand curve in the direction of lower demand of a commodity, such as energy products, induced by a prolonged period of high prices or constrained supply.

> It's one of the repeated lessons of economic history that money in the hands of the rich does much less good for the economy as a whole than money in the hands of the working classes and the poor. The reasoning here is as simple as it is inescapable. Industrial economies survive and thrive on consumer expenditures, but consumer expenditures are limited by the ability of consumers to buy the things they want and need. As money is diverted away from the lower end of the economic pyramid, you get demand destruction ‚Äî **the process by which those who can't afford to buy things stop buying them** ‚Äî and consumer expenditures fall off. The rich, by contrast, divert a large share of their income out of the consumer economy into investments; the richer they get, the more of the national wealth ends up in investments rather than consumer expenditures; and as consumer expenditures falter, and investments linked to the consumer economy falter in turn, more and more money ends up in illiquid speculative vehicles that are disconnected from the productive economy and do nothing to stimulate demand. That's what happened in the 1920s.

dissensus
:    the deliberate avoidance of consensus.

> Dissensus, a concept coined by postmodern theorist Ewa Ziarek, is the deliberate avoidance of consensus. It has its place when consensus, for one reason or another, is either impossible or unwise: for instance, when irreducible differences make it impossible to find common ground for agreement on the points that matter, or when settling on any common decision would be premature. In situations of these kinds, encouraging people to pursue conflicting and even diametrically opposed options increases the chance that someone will happen on an answer that works.

‚Äì John Michael Greer, _The Ecotechnic Future: Envisioning a Post-Peak World,_ p. 96

> Evolution is dissensus in action, the outward pressure of genetic diversification running up against the limits of environment and, now and then, pushing through to some new adaptation: the wings of bats, the opposable thumbs of primates, the cultural evolution of human beings. As we enter a future of new limits and unpredictable opportunities, this is arguably the kind of organic process we need most.

They are endowed with flabby bags for a body, some ineffectual spiny tendrils, and dangling dark bits of uncertain purpose. One might conjecture that they are mutant shellfish that survived having their shells dissolved by the carbonic acid in the seawater. Being vegans, the vegans would never think of eating one; nor anything else that washes up on the shores of that brownish, carbonated ocean, almost lifeless after that final, desperate binge of coal-burning that occurred just as oil and gas were running out. Picking dead sea squirrels off the beach with a pointed stick is an unpleasant chore, making it useful for teaching children the subtle difference between work and play. Sea squirrels have but two charms: they are at times plentiful, and, dried into flat chips, they burn with a clean, yellow flame ‚Äì not bad for illumination, and convenient for cooking the food which the vegans both plant and harvest all along the shore.

## Earthshot

<kbd>Identify / Coin</kbd>

earthshot
:   An ambitious project aimed at a society several steps lower in complexity than the one sustainable at that time. The [startdown](#startdown) equivalent of a moonshot. Example: [Collapse OS](#collapse-os)    
    > Startups do moonshots, [startdowns](#startdown) point the rocket down to Earth.

In a decline regime (assuming [catabolic collapse](#catabolic-collapse)) short-term, incremental projects risk failure when society drops to a lower level of complexity. It's not possible to predict when problems will arise, but it is possible to judge the resilience of things a project depends on. For instance, if success depends on a highly complex technological suite (eg. supercomputer clusters), it's vulnerable to numerous kinds of disruptions, thus more likely to fail (see [Liebig's law of the minimum](#liebigs-law-of-the-minimum)).

Over time we may witness a [Red Queen](#red-queen-effect) dynamic in which the rate of project failure increases due to complex systems collapse contagion. Projects cease to be viable, causing diminishing returns and leaving assets stranded. Take [renewable energy](#renewables) ‚Äì deploying wind and solar power could compensate fossil fuel use during their lifetime but they depend on a fossil fueled industrial base to get rebuilt. If that isn't available or economical at that time, the energy output drops and the systems it supported become stranded.

Therefore it is sensible to dedicate some of the projects to **a level of complexity several steps lower than the one sustainable at that time.** _Expensive, hard or unlikely tasks of great potential impact_ (moonshots) are better protected from collapse contagion if their dependencies can be sustained at lower levels of complexity.

Picture a military retreat: exhaust the benefits of a position, abandon it before it becomes unsustainable, then fall back far enough to a position you have ample resources to defend. Aiming further down the arc of decline allows for better fortification of that position as a backstop.

The idea for the term originates in [Bret Victor's snarky tweets](https://twitter.com/worrydream/status/631360757272154112)

## Electric vehicles

> Another often overlooked fact is that a wholesale conversion to electric cars will destroy the market for gasoline. Nobody is even suggesting getting rid of diesel trucks or construction equipment, emergency diesel generators or locomotives, or ships which run on bunker fuel, or having jet aircraft burn anything other than jet fuel, so petroleum distillates will still be in high demand. But they will now be twice as expensive. You see, roughly half of what can be usefully produced from a barrel of crude oil is what ends up being blended and marketed as gasoline. If that half of each oil barrel can‚Äôt be sold, the prices of the remaining liquid fuels will double, as will freight rates. This will trigger a recession that will, among other things, destroy demand for electric cars. If gasoline prices drop through the floor and electricity rates shoot through the roof, what sane person would choose an electric car? **And so it turns out that converting to electric cars is a good way to‚Ä¶ not convert to electric cars.**

> But scientists and historians who study catastrophes for a living have long known that there is, in fact, very little antisocial behavior that takes place after disasters. Rebecca Solnit‚Äôs extraordinary book _A Paradise Built in Hell_ describes in great detail the collective sense of ‚Äúimmersion in the moment and solidarity with others‚Äù that follows large-scale calamities. The common person rises to the situation to help other people, and there can be a profound experience of well-being, inventiveness, and flexibility. In fact, the worst effects in the aftermath of disasters come when institutions try to impose top-down organization, as the military might. The presumption of mass chaos, looting, murders, rapes‚Äîthis comes from something disaster scientists call **‚Äúelite panic,‚Äù** when people in positions of power fear the loss of their power and so overreact in violent ways. Solnit quotes the sociologist Kathleen Tierney‚Äôs description of the phenomenon:

## Ghost acreage

<kbd>[üë§ William R. Catton Jr.](#william-r-catton-jr)</kbd> - Overshoot

> Q: Could you elaborate on what ‚Äúghost acreage‚Äù is and why it is important to Britain‚Äôs Industrial Revolution?

> A: Ghost acreage is a term coined by Kenneth Pomeranz to help explain how Britain and other western European nations industrialized. The basic idea of ‚Äúghost acreage‚Äù is that imperial powers, like Britain, France, the Netherlands, and others, could draw upon resources from lands outside their borders, enabling those nations to support much larger economies than they otherwise could. For example, because of the economic connection between Britain and the United States, the cotton mills of Britain added ‚Äúghost acreage‚Äù from the U.S. South. This freed up good land in Britain for farmers to grow more food to feed the rapidly growing industrial population of Britain. If the British were to try to produce cotton within their own national borders, they would not only struggle to grow it in the wrong climate, but alternatives such as flax or sheep would chew up valuable acres of land British farmers could otherwise be using to grow food. Ghost acreage also comes into play when discussing new types of energy, such as coal. British industrialists could have burned wood to fuel their new machines, but they would have had to purchase and burn wood from throughout Europe and North America at great expense. By burning millions of tons of coal, it was as if the British had suddenly acquired billions of acres of underground forests. As with plantations, the use of coal freed up land for other purposes, such as agriculture, or it allowed for wood to be used in shipbuilding and construction instead of as fuel. Ghost acreage is an important concept because it reminds us of the ecological aspects of the industrial revolution; by drawing on natural resources from overseas and underground, the small island nation of Britain was able to escape its ecological constraints and start the Industrial Revolution.

Information processing with computers underpins present societal complexity and enables desireable adaptation and conservation measures. But it relies on a vastly complex high-tech supply chain that is vulnerable to disruptions.

The Great Refactoring would be the effort to reinvent computing so it's sustainable in the deindustrial future.

Probably re-imagining it to work on a substrate other than the current one, electronics. Silicon chips, electricity, radio communications are all difficult to support without a fossil-fuel subsidized industrial base operating in a stable environment. At least at current levels of performance and cost. 

Even though information processing capabilities are not inherently tied to this physical incarnation of electronic computers, The Great Refactoring is likely a doomed [earthshot](#earthshot), a pipe dream. Although several proofs-of-concept for computing on novel substrates exist in the lab, time, money, planning and physical constraints hamper their timely roll-out.

high-tech dip
:   entombed complexity. a pattern of using high technology to reduce reliance on high technology in the future.  
    _Those folks over at the lab are using artificial neural networks to compress all that knowledge into a handful of slide rules_

Making use of advanced technology today to vet best practices that can be passed on and implemented by low-tech means.

Example: arriving at simpler proxies for high-tech tests. Listened to Dan Kittridge speaking about which lab he works with to get his soil tested, rarer minerals were tested as a bonus. If the tests rely on a burdensome technological suite, maybe we can leverage AI pattern matching to displace those tests, relying only on simpler DIY tests but getting sufficient information from them.

Another example: (mechanical engineering) genetic algorhythm generating millions of designs for a part, stress testing all of them in computer simulation and selecting the most optimal solution. That design can then be copied by craftsmen with hand tools. Ideally it is distributed with documentation (mentioning what it's optimized for, how and why). Or only the form was passed on, to be reproduced _in the dark._ A technology suite that requires high-tech only on the first iterations.

Another different example: using advances in cognitive science to develop teaching and learning methodologies, maximizing the chance that more people will learn new skills required by changing circumstances, faster.

Because the high-tech that generated the artifact is lost or unsustainable in the new context a high-tech dip is a [dead man walking](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/dead_man_walking) technological suite.

### Sprints and scrambles

As a way to preserve benefits of high complexity, along the arc of collapse we may see a scramble for high-tech dips, sprints to rules of thumb. Seeing complex systems simplify (collapse), people will want to extract value from them before they're gone for good. To do so they will have to apply this pattern.

a **rapid growth rate,** **a limit,** and a **feedback signal** to slow down that accumulation of boats that's **coming too late** to keep the system from going over an important **threshold** beyond which the system begins to **erode.** Those things together make not only an unsustainable system but a system that's almost certainly going to crash.

> The monkey trap is, as the name suggests, a device for trapping monkeys. It is ingenuous in its simplicity, and also in the fact that it does not actually trap the monkey at all: it is the monkey that does the trapping. The trap consists of a hollowed-out gourd tied to a tree using a vine. The gourd has an opening just big enough to admit a monkey's paw when it isn't clenched into a fist. Inside is a banana. The monkey reaches inside, grabs the banana, but cannot withdraw it. Even as the hunter approaches to collect it, it cannot bring itself to unclench its fist, let go of the banana and escape. What traps the monkey is the monkey's own internal cost/benefit analysis, which is slanted toward the short term, coupled with its inability to consider the long-term effect of its short-term decisions. It is a perfect metaphor for what has caused the US to go off the rails.

## Progressivism

What social scientists label a ‚Äúprogressivist‚Äù view supposes that cultural complexity is intentional and that it emerged through the inventiveness of our ancestors. Progressivism is the dominant ideology of free-market societies. A sort of ancestor myth. The concepts of civilization and progress have a status in the cosmology of industrial societies that amounts to what anthropologists call ‚Äúancestor myths.‚Äù Ancestor myths validate a contemporary social order by presenting it as a natural and sometimes heroic progression from earlier times.

([Joseph Tainter - Human Resource Use - Timing and Implications for Sustainability](http://www.theoildrum.com/node/5745))

The Utterly Dismal Theorem - directly challenges the progressivist view:
Any technical improvement can only relieve misery for a while, for as long as misery is the only check on population, the improvement will enable population to grow, and will soon enable more people to live in misery than before. The final result of improvements, therefore, is to increase the equilibrium population, which is to increase the sum total of human misery (Boulding, 1959: vii [emphases in original]).

## Red Queen Effect

[Cassandra's Legacy: Some reflections on the Twilight of the Oil Age - part I](http://cassandralegacy.blogspot.com/2016/07/some-reflections-on-twilight-of-oil-age.html)

> Many readers are no doubt familiar with the so-called ‚ÄúRed Queen‚Äù effect illustrated in Figure 2 ‚Äì to have to run fast to stay put, and even faster to be able to move forward. The OI is fully caught in it.

![Figure 2 ‚Äì Stuck on a one track to nowhere](http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-PVwipqiMKVE/V4TvbcHkOpI/AAAAAAAABmM/tcYtD14-vhggvSMoE_LN4wYhJI_tgH9pQCK4B/s1600/nGeni-Looking%2Bdown%2Bthe%2Bbarrel-v10.3.006.png)

> ‚ÄòNow, here, you see, it takes all the running you can do, to keep in the same place. If you want to get somewhere else, you must run at least twice as fast as that!‚Äô - Lewis Carroll - Through the Looking-glass

Due to the rapid decline of net energy per barrel, the Oil Industry is under the sway of the **Red Queen Effect**. It must _run_ faster and faster, pumping more and more oil per year, to meet end-users' demands -- ditto for all other fossil and nuclear resources that are subject to the same Red Queen Effect.
But the net energy/barrel all need to keep running will have run out by about 2026.

> ‚ÄòNow, here, you see, if you run too fast you die!‚Äô
(paraphrasing Lewis Carroll)

All alternatives, PVs, wind turbines, biomass, shale oil, tar sands, new nuclear etc. are under the sway of the **Inverse Red Queen Effect**:

- if they grow at above 7%/year, the energy needed for their build out drains net energy out of the industrial world, just when much more of it is required
- while they actually need to grow at 35%/year to address the _Perfect Storm_ over the next 10 years ‚Äì at that rate the net energy drain would kill the industrial world

Currently, globally, about 88% of all energy resources are used wastefully -- a waste worth over ‚Ç¨5 trillion/year globally. **However, by retrieving waste heat and making productive use of it, it is feasible to sustainably circumvent the RQ & 1/RQ Effects & tap into those lost funds**

## Redundancy

relinquishment
:    within <kbd>[üë§ Jem Bendell](#jem-bendell)</kbd>'s framework of [Deep Adaptation](#deep-adaptation), _it involves people and communities **letting go** of certain assets, behaviours and beliefs where retaining them could make matters worse._

> Examples include withdrawing from coastlines, shutting down vulnerable industrial facilities, or giving up expectations for certain types of consumption

## Relocation

<kbd>Preparation</kbd>

> What are the best places to be, leading up to or during collapse, that I can get to, and establish myself in such a way that I can maintain the best standard of living possible for as long as I can or simply increase my probability of surviving the incoming population bottleneck.

[Where‚Äôs the best place to live in light of collapse? : collapse](https://www.reddit.com/r/collapse/comments/d5ar30/wheres_the_best_place_to_live_in_light_of_collapse/)

Your personal relocation strategy is a question of what you **can achieve** and what **you desire.**
Your list will however match other people's list to a great extent, so you must **find trade-offs** ‚Äì **creative [ecological niches](#niche).**

Example: 

> Do you like not living in unbearable heat, maybe moving to greenland is NOT a better option than just buying 400W of solar panels and attaching it to a small efficient AC that keeps one room of your house cool even during summer electricity blackouts. Most problems have multiple solutions, it is worth it to take time and think about things from an economic perspective and different time horizon perspectives.

Another scenario to illustrate the importance of finding a niche:

> Imagine you are a goat herder in Somalia during a multi year drought and there is no grass for feeding your animals. You have to sell them for dirt cheap because everyone else is also trying to sell off everything they can to get money thus depressing the goat prices further. Now the price of food is skyrocketing because there is no grass and the farmers crops failed, everyone is trying to buy up a hoard of food because everyone knows it is going to be a hard year. You manage to get the equivalent of $120USD in cash after selling practically everything you own but held onto one breeding pair of your healthiest goats you plan to use to regain a livelihood after the drought is over.

To aim for the optimal resilience think: if I find myself in dire straits will I be alone (too fragile), in the same boat with millions others (too competitive) or alongside a small community, collaborating to mutually overcome the difficulty (ideal)?

A meta-heuristic is to look to **increase your optionality.**

## Renewables

> ‚ÄúRenewable‚Äù energy technologies are misnamed ‚Äî ‚Äúrebuildable‚Äù is a more fitting name for them

A chicken is renewable. They can reproduce themselves based on solar and hydrological flows, and finding another chicken. A Prius or a wind tower aren‚Äôt renewable ‚Äì they‚Äôre rebuildable.

‚Äì [üë§ Nate Hagens](#nate-hagens)

Some problems with trasitioning to wind and solar power infrastructure:

> Completely gratuitous use of the term "renewable". For wind and solar, the energy source for power generation may be renewable, but the technology is not. Every 15-20 years it has to be "renewed" using industrial production that is based on nonrenewable resources, many of them already scarce. Solar panels and wind turbine blades are not only nonrenewable but largely nonrecyclable and, in the case of solar panels, constitute toxic waste. The push for "renewables" has in each case paved the path toward rapid deindustrialization and offshoring of industrial production; in the future, these "advanced" (read, "deindustrlalized") economies will be unable to import expensive "renewable" technology and will lose access to electricity.

In the future, we will not be able to maintain their extreme performance facing the increasing costs of rare mineral resources. That doesn't mean that smartphones will disappear (although that's not impossible) but it means that some kind of compromise between performance and cost will have to be reached.

During [my talk I did a quick poll](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ke1PCgiM3V4) to discover that about 90 percent of the officials in the room believed that collapse is coming within their lifetimes. Yet their ability to conceive of what was appropriate to discuss as policy responses and activism was, in general, woeful. The ideas being shared were more of the same tinkering with capitalism and redirecting private investment into mitigation efforts. Why? One hypothesis is that **the highest have the farthest to fall.** If one is well-respected, well-paid, and living well in the current system, perhaps with a sense of responsibility for lots of employees and stakeholders, then one has the most to let go of in order to allow the full impact of our current situation to sink in. At a sub-conscious level it eats away at assumptions you didn‚Äôt know you had. For instance, assuming that one would be respected by your children and younger generations as you enter old age, and, ultimately as you lie on your death bed. To be successful in society means one is having affirmed, daily, the illusion of the socially-respected agentic separate Self. Instead, our climate chaos invites us to see that we aren‚Äôt separate, we aren‚Äôt in control and our stories of self-respect and meaning were always made up. We must let our deepest assumptions and stories melt away to find what else can emerge. That may be why I have a better time talking to children about collapse than I do talking to people with senior jobs.

[Soft Development Paths - The Gupta Option](http://guptaoption.com/7.soft_development_paths.php)

> The soft development path is an alternative approach to spreading results like those of the Kerala Miracle, in which an Indian region with an average income of $300 per year has attained quality of life as measured by lifespans, literacy and infant mortality very close to those of rich nations. Although not every area may enjoy Kerala's unique social advantages, Kerala proves that it is possible to live well on very little money or ecological impact. Kerala proves it can be done, and appropriate technology will lower the barriers to this kind of success in other regions.

‚Äì <kbd>[üë§ Toby Hemenway](#toby-hemenway)</kbd>

### The Four Questions of Sustainability

> We can bring a degree of rigor to our discourse by a simple step. Each time one hears the word sustainability insist that the speaker answer four questions:

> 1. Sustain **what?**
> 2. Sustain it **for whom?**
> 3. Sustain it **for how long?** and
> 4. Sustain it **at what cost?**

> These questions appear simple on the surface but the ease with which they may be offered obscures their power. Asking these questions carries one deeply into a rigorous assessment of what sustainability means and how it may be achieved in specific situations.

> Of course, a ship like this one would never have worked. Think of how to feed the oxen. And think of how to manage the final results of feeding the oxen. Probably none of the curious weapons invented by our anonymous author would ever have worked. It all reminds me of Jeremy Rifkin and his hydrogen based economy. Rifkin understands what is the problem, but the solutions he proposes, well, are a little like the end result of feeding the oxen; but let me not go into that. The point is that our 4th century author does understand that the Roman Empire is in trouble. Actually, he seems to be scared to death because of what's happening. Read this sentence, I am showing it to you in the original Latin to give you a sense of the flavor of this text.

> ‚ÄúIn primis sciendum est quod imperium romanum circumlatrantium ubique nationum perstringat insania et omne latus limitum tecta naturalibus locis appetat dolosa barbaries."

> Of course you may not be able to translate from Latin on the spot. For that, being Italian gives you a definite advantage. But let me just point out a word to you: "circumlatrantium" . which refers to barbarians who are, literally, "barking around" the empire's borders. They are like dogs barking and running around; and not just barking - they are trying hard to get in. It is almost a scene from a horror movie. A nightmare. So the author of "Of matters of war" is thinking of how to get rid of these monsters. But his solutions were not so good. Actually it was just wishful thinking. None of these strange weapons were ever built. Even our 4th century author, therefore, fails completely in understanding what were the real problems of the Empire.

## Unintended consequences

> Most of us grew up using QWERTY keyboards, but they were actually designed to slow typists down so they wouldn't jam typewriters. There are far more efficient keyboard layouts (DVORAK, for instance). Changing society over would make the world generally more efficient. But we won't, because everyone already knows QWERTY and all the keyboards already have QWERTY layouts and learning new things is hard and having two systems during the switch over is twice as hard. An individual could choose to move over, but then they have to go to the extra effort, creating hardship for themselves, while really making not much of a difference at all.

> So, who do you blame for this? The original keyboard designers, who never envisioned modern computers? Companies who meet demand for QWERTY keyboards? Regulators and schools? Individuals who take the path of least resistance?

> And that's just one insignificant habit that could be fixed in a decade with the slightest bit of effort. Stopping carbon emissions, on the other hand, will outright kill billions of us.

> No person or company is ultimately responsible for climate change; it is a natural, unintended consequence of our society. The use of fossil fuels was originally well-intended by people who never imagined that they could break the planet and nothing less than utterly breaking civilization as we know it can fix it.

## Urban myth

One of the central myths of modern society is that the process of urbanization (and slumification‚Äîfavelas are currently the fastest-growing form of human habitation) is due to city life being ‚Äúmore attractive‚Äù and farming becoming ‚Äúmore efficient.‚Äù Fewer people want to or need to inhabit the wider landscape, the story goes, and so they are moving to the cities. And this, some say, is simply a good thing. But the real cause of this rapid urbanization is that economic activity is moving to the city‚Äîbecause localized, artisanal production cannot compete with centralized manufacturing. This is a temporary dislocation made possible by burning fossil fuels.

> We need to be aware of their existence because the problems we are now facing are wicked. If we cannot see a solution, that does not necessarily mean that we have not understood the problem; it may mean that there isn't one.

> The main features of a wicked problem are: 
> 
> - _Vagueness:_ they lack clear definition because they spill over into many different issues and systems.
> - _Hard to grasp:_ they can be recognised from one or two perspectives, but are too complex to understand in the round.
> - _Populated:_ they affect many people: solutions are likely to be social rather than technical.
> - _No right answer:_ the best that can be done is to pick the least bad response.
> - _Changeable:_ the problem, and attitudes bother to it and to solutions, are constantly changing.
> - _No definition:_ the problem may be hard even to identify in a form that allows it to be shared.
> - _No solution?:_ there is no objective clear definition of the problem, so no definitive solution.
> - _No clean ending:_ the problem-solving ends when money and time run out.
> 
> But do not believe that a problem is wicked because someone tells you so. Look again.
