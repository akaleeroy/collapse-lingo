As work continues this format will probably become unwieldy, we should reassess.

It's meant to be included (or linked to) in the [/r/collapse/wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/collapse/wiki/index).

## Imprecise terms and proposed terms

Some terms aren't the best fit for the concept they're meant to put across.
Others designate new notions that haven't yet got a name but would warrant one.

Mark with an <kbd>Identify / Coin</kbd> tag.

## Out of scope

Some of the concepts – while useful – are not directly related to collapse.

Mark with <kbd>Tangential</kbd>.

In the interest of minimizing clutter they could be taken out.
